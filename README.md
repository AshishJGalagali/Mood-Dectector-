## General Information
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 1 billion students worldwide facing school closures. As schools transition from remote learning, we must address the novel challenges that online learning presents. One such challenge is the inability of instructors to determine how well students are engaging with the lecture. Unlike a physical lectures where the instructor presents to a live audience, web conferences makes it difficult for the instructor to monitor the reactions of all the students. As summer ends and the fall term begins, this problem becomes even more pressing.

In order to address this problem, we came up with the idea of using ML to classify the emotional state of students in a virtual classroom. Using Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision, we trained the model using a dataset of [] images. The facial expressions can be categorized in [] ways: confused, bored, excited, tired. This would allow instructors to understand how their lesson is being perceived and get a better idea of how to shape the class to meet studentsâ€™ needs.
